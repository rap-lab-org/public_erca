# Enhanced Resource Constrained A* (ERCA*)

This work addresses a Resource Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RC-SPP) on a graph where the objective is to find a min-cost start-goal path while ensuring that the resource consumed along the path do not exceed the given limits.
This repo provides a C++ implementation of Enhanced Resource Constrained A\* (ERCA\*) Algorithm, which is guaranteed to find an optimal solution path.

## Requirements

* We use CMake (3.16.3) and Make (4.2.1) to compile the code. Lower or higher version may also work.

## Project Structure

* `README.md` - This file
* `source/` - Contains the path planning source code
* `test/` - Contains example code for path planning algorithms
* `include/` - Contains header files
* `data/` - Contains sample graph files and sample result files

## Instructions:

### Installation

* Clone this repo
* Compile this repo
  * `mkdir build`
  * `cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release` (You can specify the build type you like by adding different args)
  * `make`

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

* Run example via command-line interface (CLI)
  * `cd build/`
  * `./run_erca 1 5 60 3 ../data/ex1-c1.gr ../data/ex1-c2.gr ../data/ex1-c3.gr 10 9 ../data/result.txt`
  * Runs ERCA\* on 3-cost graph (edge weights detailed in `data/ex1-c1.txt`, `data/ex1-c2.txt`, `data/ex1-c3.txt`) to find solutions from node 1 to node 5 with a 60 second time limit, and saves results into `data/result.txt`. The cost to be minimized is defined in `data/ex1-c1.txt` while the two types of resource are defined in `data/ex1-c2.txt` and `data/ex1-c3.txt`. The resource limits are 10 and 9 respectively.
* General usage of the command-line interface
  * `./run_erca (arg1 v_start) (arg2 v_dest) (arg3 time_limit) (arg4 M) (arg5 graph1_file_path) (arg6 graph2_file_path) ... ((arg(M+4) graphM_file_path)) (arg(M+4+1) resource limit 1) (arg(M+4+2) resource limit 2) ... (arg(M+4+M-1) resource limit M-1) (arg(M+4+M) result_path)`
  * arg1 v_start = the starting node
  * arg2 v_dest = the destination node
  * arg3 time_limit = the time limit for ERCA\*
  * arg4 M = the number of criteria (including both the minimizing objective and all types of resource) for the input instance
  * arg5~arg(M+4) = the paths to M files that describe the graph, where each file contains the edge weights for one type of edge cost/resource in the graph (details about file structure are specified below)
  * arg(M+4+1)~arg(M+4+M-1) = the resource limits
  * arg(M+4+M) = the result file path
* For help info `./run_erca -h` or `./run_emoa --help`


### Graph file specification

* The input graph is directed.
* The node ID are within range 1~*n*, where *n* is the number of nodes in the graph. 
* Parallel edges are not allowed.
* Graph files must follow the same format described by [DIMACS](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it//~challenge9/format.shtml#graph).
* Graph files used in the same run must correspond to each other line-by-line.
 * In other words, it requires all cost files to have the same set of edges in the same order.
```
For example:
In c1 file, letâ€™s say we have edges:
a 0 1 26
a 2 4 26
a 3 5 114
Then in c2 file, we also need to have edges:
a 0 1 x
a 2 4 y
a 3 5 z
Here, x,y,z are non-negative integer cost values. If, for example, edge (3,5) has cost zero, this edge also need to appear in the third place (i.e., the same place as in the c1 file) in c2 file, and has a value 0.
Same rule applies to all cost files.
```

### Result file specifiction

Result file contains multiple lines of metadata: 
* rt_initHeu = runtime to initialize heuristics
* rt_search = runtime to conduct the search
* timeout = if the planner times out
* N = the number of solutions found, which is always one.

The computed solution is then listed in three lines:
* The first line contains `Label: {label_id}`, which can be ignored in practice.
* The second line contains the a vector of format (objective_value, resource_1_value, resource_2_value, ..., resource_(M-1)_value) of the solution path.
* The third line contains the solution path (a list of vertices).


### Notes for Performance

* The implementation of EMOA* (as well as the baselines as mentioned in the paper [1]) relies heavily on std::unordered_map from C++ STL for the purpose of easy implementation. Using other data structure such as std::vector (or simply arrays) can lead to significant improvement in performance than using std::unordered_map.
